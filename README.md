# AuthMaster

**AuthMaster** is a robust authentication platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It provides a comprehensive solution for managing user authentication with best practices such as signup, login, email verification, password recovery, and more.

## Features

- **User Signup & Login**: Secure registration and login functionality with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Email Verification**: Confirm user email addresses through automated verification emails.
- **Password Recovery**: Enable users to recover their passwords with a secure email-based reset process.
- **Welcome Emails**: Send personalized welcome emails upon successful registration.
- **Profile Management**: Allow users to manage their profiles, update personal information, and securely change passwords.

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
